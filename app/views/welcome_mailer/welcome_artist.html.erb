        Hello <%= @user.first_name %>,<br>

        Welcome to ArtCaring!<br>

        <p>Thank you again for joining our cause. Here's a few quick pointers to get you started. </p>

        <p>1. When you sign in, you will be directed to your Artist's Dashboard. You can access your dashboard any time you are logged in through the blue "Your Dashboard" button in the upper right of the screen.</p>

        <p>2. From your dashboard you can start your Patient Campaign. Follow the instructions you see after hitting the button.</p>

        <p>3. Write a thoughtful, compelling narrative about your Patient's situation and their importance in your life. Be descriptive but not too detailed. Be persuasive, but not overbearing! Briefly explain to art shoppers how buying your art will benefit your Patient.</p>

        <p>4. Think carefully about what percentage of your sales you'd like to keep (it's the last question on the form). <strong>This percentage can be changed once,</strong> but you will need to do it by <%= link_to "contacting us", new_message_url %> to change it on our end for you.

        <p>5. After submitting your Patient Campaign, you may start adding artworks from the Dashboard.</p>

        <p>6. Once you've got your Artworks listed, it's time to tell the world about your Campaign! Post it on Facebook, Tweet about it, etc. <strong>Most importantly, send out an article or notice to your mailing list with a link to your Patient Campaign, or write about it in your newsletter.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>7.</stong> Have fun and <%= link_to "contact us", new_message_url %> if you have any questions!</p>
