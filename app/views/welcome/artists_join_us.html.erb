    <p>1. <strong>If you're a visual artist</strong> and know someone personally who could use some financial help during a health hardship - you're in! We'd love to have you <strong><%= link_to "Sign Up", new_user_registration_path %></strong>!

    <p>2. Once you've signed-up and we've confirmed your account, you're ready to <strong>create a Patient Campaign</strong>. This is where you'll tell us about the person who will benefit from your art sales on ArtCaring.</p>

    <% if current_user and not current_user.patient_campaign %> 
      <p>Looks like you're signed-up and signed-in! <%= link_to "

    <p>4. Once your Artworks are listed, you are ready to tell the world about your Patient Campaign. <strong>Send an email/online postcard announcing your Campaign to your mailing list. You'll probably find the most success with your existing buyers and collectors!</strong></p>
    <p> People love hearing about good causes, and when they find out their favorite artist is involved, they'll want to be involved too!

    <p>5. When you set up your Patient Campaign:
      <ul>
        <li>You'll specify what percentage of your art sales - between 0% and 30% - that you'll want to keep.</li>
        <li>Your Patient will then be set up to receive between 61% and 91% of the proceeds of any Artwork sales.
        <li>ArtCaring fees are 6%, + 2.9% to cover credit card charges (all charges and payments are handled through <a href=https://stripe.com/ target="_blank">Stripe</a>).</li>
